# kops-openwhisk
This repository holds the installations scripts for the Kubernetes Cluster with OpenWhisk I used while writing my bachelor's thesis.  
Maintenance is likely to end after August 27th, 2018.


## How to use
Run the numbered Bash scripts in ascending order.  
*Warning:* there is a lot of hardcoded configuration specific to my AWS account in the Bash scripts as well as the *values-*.yaml* files!


## Note on publishing
At the time of writing this is a private repository. It will not be made public before August 27th, 2018.
